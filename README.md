# Understanding AI Orchestrators: PromptFlow vs LangChain vs Semantic Kernel
## Introduction

Data is the power behind human civilization and knowledge. Over the past decades, we have seen an increase in data shared across the internet. With the massive availability of data as well as advanced compute, models were trained to take advantage of the data to process and understand natural language. Models were trained to produce new and original content bringing about Generative AI. Globally, developers, data scientists, and engineers created new applications or advanced their existing applications to take advantage of LLMs. While building a Question and Answer chatbot is simple and you may not need advanced tools, in other more complex scenarios, the AI orchestrator come in and make the process easier. At the center of LLM applications is the AI orchestration layer that allows developers to build their own Copilot experiences. 

## What are they?
AI orchestrators are tools, libraries and/or frameworks that ease the process of creating LLM application by streamlining any repetitive process through automation. Some of the AI orchestrators include:
Semantic Kernel: an open-source SDK that allows you to orchestrate your existing code and more with AI.
LangChain: a framework to build LLM-applications easily and gives you insights on how the application works
PromptFlow: this is a set of developer tools that helps you build an end-to-end LLM Applications. Using PromptFlow, you can take your application from an idea to production.

## Scenario
Let’s delve into a practical scenario. Imagine you want to develop a Language Tutor—an application specifically focused on Swahili. Users can quickly learn basic greetings and perform essential tasks in Swahili. By leveraging the power of these orchestrators, you can bring your vision to life and enhance language learning experiences.
